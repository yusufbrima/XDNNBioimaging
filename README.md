# XDNNBioimaging

Tensorflow implementation for the pre-print [What do Deep Neural Networks Learn in Medical Images?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00953)

## Description

This is a proof-of-concept to allow non-programmers from the CBC (and elsewhere?) to gain access to the model for inference via a simple web interface. However, the code is underdevelopment and will be incrementally improved.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* For now, all dependencies are in the requirements.txt file and can be installed with a *pip install requirements.txt* command. However, the code was written in Python 3.9.12, which shouldn't be much of a hassle installing.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

* Clone this repo
* cd into the repo (from terminal)
* pip install requirements.txt

### Executing program

* export FLASK_APP = app.py # On Windows CMD, use *set* instead of *export*
* flask fun
